## Study Context

- **Classroom Activities:** Exercises and projects completed under instructor guidance.  
- **Homework Assignments:** Exercises done independently to reinforce concepts.  
- **Independent Study:** Additional projects and exercises for deepening and practice.

This repository reflects the evolution and consolidation of knowledge gained through these different learning contexts.

## Objectives

- Consolidate basic programming fundamentals.  
- Develop logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.  
- Achieve proficiency in core object-oriented programming principles.  
- Prepare for advanced academic challenges and real-world software development demands.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Primary Language:** Java  
- **Recommended IDEs:** IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse  
- **Version Control:** Git, hosted on GitHub

## How to Run Examples

Most code examples are written in Java and structured with one main class per file. To run them from the terminal:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `.java` file.  
2. Compile the file:

```
ClassName.java
````

You should see the expected output in the terminal.

Alternatively, open the file in your preferred IDE and use the built-in run/debug tools.

## Code Style Guide

- Use **CamelCase** for class names (e.g., `MyClass`).  
- Use **camelCase** for method and variable names (e.g., `calculateSum`).  
- Indent using 4 spaces.  
- Keep methods short and focused.  
- Write meaningful comments where necessary.  
- Follow consistent formatting throughout the project.  

---

## Repository Guidelines

- Include only content relevant to the covered topics.  
- Ensure code is clean, efficient, and well-documented.  
- Use consistent naming conventions for folders and files.  
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.  
- Do not commit sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).  
- Add usage instructions or test cases when applicable.

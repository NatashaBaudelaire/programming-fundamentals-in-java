## How to Run Examples

Most code examples are written in Java and are structured with a single main class per file.

From the terminal:  

1. Navigate to the folder containing the `.java` file  
2. Compile the file using:

```bash
javac ClassName.java
```

3. Run the compiled programme:  

```bash
java ClassName
```
> Replace `filename.java` with the actual file name.

Alternatively, you can utilise the built-in run/debug tools in your preferred IDE.

## Code Style Guide

- **Classes:** `CamelCase` (e.g., `MyClass`)  
- **Methods & Variables:** `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateSum`)  
- **Constants:** `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `PI_VALUE`)  
- **Packages:** lowercase (e.g., `utilities`)  
- Indentation: 4 spaces  
- Keep methods short and focused  
- Write meaningful comments where necessary  
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the project

---

## Repository Guidelines

- Include only Java-related content relevant to the topics
- Maintain clean, efficient, and well-documented code
- Use consistent naming conventions for files and directories
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Do not commit sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys)
- Add usage instructions or test cases where necessary

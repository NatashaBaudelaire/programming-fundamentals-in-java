## How to Run Examples

Most code examples are written in Java and structured with one main class per file.  

From the terminal:  

1. Navigate to the directory containing the `.java` file.  
2. Compile the file:  

```bash
javac ClassName.java
```

3. Run the compiled program:  

```bash
java ClassName
```

Alternatively, open the file in your preferred IDE and use the built-in run/debug tools.

## Code Style Guide

- **Classes:** `CamelCase` (e.g., `MyClass`)  
- **Methods & Variables:** `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateSum`)  
- **Constants:** `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `PI_VALUE`)  
- **Packages:** lowercase (e.g., `utilities`)  
- Indentation: 4 spaces  
- Keep methods short and focused  
- Write meaningful comments where necessary  
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout the project
